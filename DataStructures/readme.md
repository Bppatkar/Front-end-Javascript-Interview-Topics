- Two Sum: Given an array of integers and a target value, find two numbers in the array that add up to the target.

- Reverse String: Write a function to reverse a string without using built-in reverse functions.

- Palindrome Check: Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

- FizzBuzz: Print the numbers from 1 to n, but replace multiples of 3 with "Fizz" and multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz."

- Factorial: Write a function to compute the factorial of a given non-negative integer.

- Merge Two Sorted Arrays: Given two sorted arrays, merge them into a single sorted array.

- Remove Duplicates: Given a sorted array, remove duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.

- Valid Parentheses: Write a function to determine if a given string containing only brackets ('(', ')', '{', '}', '[', ']') is valid.

- Counting Elements: Given an array of integers, find the count of the elements that are smaller than a given element.

- Max Subarray Sum: Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) that has the largest sum.

- Longest Common Prefix: Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

- Rotate Array: Rotate an array to the right by k steps.

- Intersection of Two Arrays: Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

- Single Number: Given a non-empty array of integers where every element appears twice except for one, find that single element.

- Missing Number: Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.
