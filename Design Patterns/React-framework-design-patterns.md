- When designing a React-like framework, several design patterns are crucial for maintaining a scalable and maintainable codebase. Here are some design patterns commonly used in the context of building frameworks like React:

# Component Pattern:
Organize your UI into reusable components. Each component should encapsulate its own logic 
and have a well-defined API.

# Virtual DOM Pattern:
Implement a virtual DOM to efficiently update the actual DOM. This involves 
creating a lightweight representation of the DOM tree and updating only the necessary 
parts when the state changes.

# Observer Pattern:
Use the observer pattern to establish a relationship between components and 
the state. When the state changes, notify the interested components to re-render.

# Composite Pattern:
Represent components in a tree structure using the composite pattern. This allows you 
to treat individual components and their compositions uniformly.

# Factory Pattern:
Employ the factory pattern to create components. This can help centralize component 
creation logic and make it easier to extend or modify the creation process.

# Container-Component Pattern:
Distinguish between container components (handling logic and state management) and 
presentational components (focused on rendering UI). This promotes a clean separation of concerns.

# Higher-Order Component (HOC) Pattern:
Use HOCs to wrap components and add additional functionality. This pattern is handy 
for code reuse and separating concerns like logic and presentation.

# Render Props Pattern:
Implement the render props pattern to share code between components by passing a 
function as a prop. This can facilitate component composition and code reuse.

# Context Pattern:
Leverage React context to share data that can be considered global across the component 
tree. This is especially useful for passing down data without explicitly passing props through each level.

# Middleware Pattern:
Consider using middleware to intercept and augment the behavior of certain operations, 
such as handling actions or events in the framework.

# Decorator Pattern:
Apply the decorator pattern to extend the functionality of components dynamically. 
This can be useful for adding features or behaviors without modifying the component directly.

# Dependency Injection Pattern:
Use dependency injection to manage and provide dependencies to components. This can 
enhance testability and maintainability.
