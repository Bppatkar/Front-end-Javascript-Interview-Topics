- In software engineering, several design patterns are commonly used to solve recurring problems in 
  software design. Here are some of the most common design patterns:

## Creational Patterns:

# Singleton: 
    Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

# Factory Method: 
Creates an instance of several derived classes, allowing the client code to create 
objects without specifying their exact class.

# Abstract Factory: 
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects 
without specifying their concrete classes.

# Builder: 
Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing 
the same construction process to create different representations.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Structural Patterns:

# Adapter: 
Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper 
with a compatible interface.

# Decorator: 
Dynamically adds behaviors or responsibilities to objects without modifying their code.

# Facade: 
Provides a simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it 
easier to use.

# Composite: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Behavioral Patterns:

# Observer: 
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, 
all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

# Strategy: 
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

# Command: 
Turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request.

# State: 
Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.

# Iterator: 
Provides a way to access elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Architectural Patterns:

# Model-View-Controller (MVC): 
Separates an application into three interconnected components - Model 
(data and logic), View (presentation), and Controller (user input handling).

# Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM): 
Similar to MVC, but with emphasis on separating the UI logic from the 
UI presentation through the ViewModel.

# Layered Architecture: 
Separates an application into different layers (e.g., presentation, business 
    logic, data access) to promote modularity and maintainability.
