// 1) We have two numbers, a and b, a > b. Please write the script that outputs (you can use console.log) the result of
//integer division of a/b, and a remainder of the division. Example: if a = 14 and b = 4, the result of integer division 14/4 would be 3, and the remainder is 2.
// 2) Write a function that takes a number as an argument and returns its factorial (factorial of N is a product of numbers from 1 to N, so factorial of 5 is 1*2*3*4*5 = 120)
// 3) Write a function that returns the length of the longest word in the provided sentence.
